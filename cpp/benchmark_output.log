Authors: Carolina Bencosme-10148929 y Manuel Rodr√≠guez-10150681
Starting benchmark execution...

Total combinations to execute: 1500
Progress will be reported every 25 combinations
Note: Large arrays may take several hours per algorithm
BubbleSort timeouts: 5min(50K), 10min(100K), 30min(500K), 1hour(1M)
Other algorithms timeout: 600 seconds
NO ALGORITHMS WILL BE SKIPPED - All will run or timeout

Testing algorithm: BubbleSort
